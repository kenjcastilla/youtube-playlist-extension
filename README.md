# YouTube Playlist Chrome Extension

I like to know when I added something to a list or playlist, whether it be for music, articles, or *videos* .

This extension injects a content script into the page of the respective YouTube playlist and appends the date each video was added to the playlist to the metadata section of the video.

After activating the extension, the date each video was added to the playlist will be displayed next to the date the video was published in YYYY-MM-DD format.
